Implemetaion of K-means algorithem in python 3 
Given a set of N datapoints x1, x2, . . . ,xN belongs to R^d, the goal is to group the data into K nutural clusters,
each datapoint is assigned to exactly one cluster and the number of clusters K is such that 1 < K < N.
We will denote the group of clusters by S1, S2, . . . ,SK, each cluster Sj is represented by it’s centroid
which is the mean μj belongs to R^d of the cluster’s members.
